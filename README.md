Hi, I am Farah! I am a data scientist and an analytics leader operating in the US health care space for 10+ years. I am passionate about using data to improve all sorts of outcomes - quality of care, financial, operational and regulatory! After years of monitoring data quality metrics, holding my breath for decimal places and writing weird SQL queries to find all the gaps in data, I tend to get very excited about all things data. 

I have experience working with: SQL, Python, R, Tableau, SAS.

I have also recently completed a Masters in Analytics from Georgia Tech. 


## Projects

Here are some of the projects I have completed in the last couple of years:

  Fatalities from Traffic Crashes Across US in 2022 - Tableau Dashboard Visualization
</a> 

  This dashboard provides an overview of traffic crashes across United States as they have occurred over the year 2022, that can be zoomed to a county and a road level. The dashboard provides an opportunity to observe the changes in fatality risk depending on day of week, lighting and weather conditions. We can also observe which highways and roads have fatal crashes most commonly occurred.

  Multi-class model to classify obesity levels based on physical and behavioral health features
</a> 

  In this project, I trained and evaluated two ensemble approaches: random forests and gradient boosting to classify obesity levels (ranging from Insufficient Weight to High Obesity) based on BMI. Overall, random forest model performed slightly better than gradient boosting. The latter was prone was overfitting on the training set. Concluded that age and gender were the most important features, followed by number of meals consumed per day, vegetable consumption and family history with overweight.

  Sentiment Analysis of IMDb movie reviews - a binary classification model to classify positive and negative reviews 
</a> 

  I analyzed movie review data from Kaggle, to classify reviews as either positive or negative based on sentiment analysis. To do this, I utilized spaCy and Natural Language ToolKit (NLTK) packages in Python to clean the data, and the TF-IDF vectorizer to convert words into feature vectors based on their importance in reviews compared to overall corpus. Trained various machine learning binary classification models on the vectorized data and selected logistic regression as the best classifier based on test set data performance.
